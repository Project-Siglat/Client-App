SIGLAT PROJECT RULES

1. Always read rule.txt first
2. Always document everything every prompt, summarize it, every prompt must be a diary
3. Our principle is minimalist and lightweight
4. Use tmux for running in the background after we finish stuffs
5. Push only in compilation branch, push everytime we finish a prompt
6. Do not check if Docker is running, use it as it was
7. Do not use sudo when running Docker commands

Repository URLs:
- UI: git@github.com:Craftmatrix24/SIGLAT-UI.git
- API: git@github.com:Craftmatrix24/SIGLAT-API.git

Workflow:
- Clone repos
- Go to localhost branch
- Create "compilation" branch based on localhost
- Push compilation branch immediately
- Work only in compilation branch
- Push after every prompt completion
